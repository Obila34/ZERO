This is the single source of truth for HOW the model should talk and WHICH cue
tags it may emit. The TTS orchestrator consumes the very same vocabulary, so the
prompt stays engine-agnostic: the LLM always writes `[laughs]`, and whichever
engine is active translates it (Fish -> `(laughing)`, Piper -> spliced clip).
